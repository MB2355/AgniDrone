# 🔥 Firefighting / Rescue Drone Project

> A student-led drone development project aimed at designing and prototyping a heavy-lift, manually controlled drone with potential firefighting and rescue capabilities.

## 📌 About the Project

This project was carried out during our 4th semester under the **Maker Bhavan Foundation**, with access to tools, materials, and mentorship at **Maker Bhavan IITGN**.

Our objective was to:
- Understand the fundamentals of drone electronics and control.
- Learn by building: from assembling a basic kit to designing a custom hexacopter.
- Explore future implementations of fire detection and rescue automation.

## 🛠️ What We Built

### 1. 📦 Phase 1: Training & Understanding
- Assembled a beginner drone kit.
- Learned drone electronics, flight controllers, and tuning parameters.
- Identified hidden SD card issue in RadioLink CrossFlight FC (funny in hindsight 😅).
- Performed initial test flights.

### 2. 🚁 Phase 2: Custom Heavy-Lift Hexacopter
- Custom-designed **Plus-type** hexacopter frame.
- Used **PVC pipes** and 3D printed PLA joints/motor mounts.
- Frame required **zero screws** (except motor and frame connection😉).
- Structural design and simulation done using **ANSYS** and **Autodesk Inventor**.
- Powered by **BLDC motors** and controlled via **Pixhawk** flight controller.
- Performed **manual PID tuning** and achieved stable flight.

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Working across domains (mechanical, electrical, and programming).
- Hands-on experience in drone tuning and real-world electronics.
- Team collaboration, time management, and rapid prototyping.
- Respecting wire polarities, specially in drones, can burn your components so be safe: Red = +, Black = ground 😅

---

## 🚧 Next Steps

- Add fire detection system (IR/thermal camera).
- Implement autonomous flight and object avoidance.
- Deploy payload-drop/rescue modules.
- Autonomous GPS-based navigation.
